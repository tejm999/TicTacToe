Tic Tac Toe Game

Description:
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Java. 
It provides a command-line interface for players to take turns marking their symbols ('X' or 'O') on a 3x3 grid. 
The game ends when one player achieves a winning pattern (three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal) or when the board is filled, resulting in a draw.

Features:
Player vs Player mode: Two players can take turns playing against each other.
Interactive interface: Players are prompted to enter their moves through the command line.
Win and draw detection: The game detects winning moves and declares the winner accordingly. It also recognizes when the game ends in a draw.

How to Play:
Run the program.
Players will be prompted to enter their moves by specifying the cell number they want to mark with their symbol ('X' or 'O').
The game will continue until one player wins or the board is filled, resulting in a draw.
At the end of each game, players will have the option to play again.
